<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Fast and Furious</h3>
<p>This series may have gotten out of hand.. but the original was just fantastic.</p>
<h3>Pacific Rim</h3>
<p>This movie is so off the rails from every aspect that it makes it amazing.<br> 10/10 would watch all of the time.</p>
<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>Shia LeBeuf (sp*) was young and believable as young. Obviously my Pacific rim take lets you know how I feel about big <br> monster movies. Yeah this movie has it all. Megan Fox... at the time... I mean come on. Me and my wife were dating at the time. Life was simple.</p>
